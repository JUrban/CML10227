This is the CML10227 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).


There are large 10227 problems in the benchmark in the directory
"problems". They are listed in the file ProblemsInProcessingOrder and
contain altogether 88960 formulas. The problems are created by
first-order export [1] of theorems and definitions from 340 CakeML [2] and
HOL4 [3] files, listed in FilesInProcessingOrder.

The problems were extracted only from the 102 CakeML theories listed
in the file ProblemTheories.


2017 of these large problems could be proved by the Vampire 4.0 ATP
system either from its original HOL4 proof dependencies or with axiom
selection using the k-nearest neighbor machine learning method [1]
trained on other proofs.  All these 2017 proofs are available in the
directory proofs.
